# Neovim Config

This is my neovim config, heavily inspired by [LunarVim](https://lunarvim.org).

## Design goals:
- Stay true to stock (neo)vim so it isn't difficult to switch back and forth.
- Create an "IDE" experience
- Lazy load plugins when I can
- Things should look nice, but stay out of the way
